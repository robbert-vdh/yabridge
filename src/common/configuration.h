/**
 * An object that's used to provide plugin-specific configuration. Right now
 * this is only used to declare plugin groups. A plugin group is a set of
 * plugins that will be hosted in the same process rather than individually so
 * they can share resources. Configuration file loading works as follows:
 *
 * 1. `load_config_for(path, ...)` from `src/plugin/utils.h` gets called with a
 *    path to the copy of or symlink to `libyabridge-{clap,vst2,vst3}.so` that
 *    the plugin host has tried to load.
 * 2. We start looking for a file named `yabridge.toml` in the same directory as
 *    that `.so` file, iteratively continuing to search one directory higher
 *    until we either find the file or we reach the filesystem root.
 * 3. If the file is found, then parse it as a TOML file and look for the first
 *    table whose key is a glob pattern that (partially) matches the relative
 *    path between the found `yabridge.toml` and the `.so` file. As a rule of
 *    thumb, if the `find <pattern> -type f` command executed in Bash would list
 *    the `.so` file, then the following table in `yabridge.tmol` would also
 *    match the same `.so` file:
 *
 *    ```toml
 *    ["<patern>"]
 *    group = "..."
 *    ```
 * 4. If one of these glob patterns could be matched with the relative path of
 *    the `.so` file then we'll use the settings specified in that section.
 *    Otherwise the default settings will be used.
