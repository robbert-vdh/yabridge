Yet Another way to use Windows audio plugins on Linux. Yabridge seamlessly
supports using both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows VST2, VST3, and CLAP plugins in
64-bit Linux plugin hosts as if they were native plugins, with optional support
for [plugin groups](#plugin-groups) to enable inter-plugin communication for
VST2 plugins and quick startup times. Its modern concurrent architecture and
focus on transparency allows yabridge to be both fast and highly compatible,
while also staying easy to debug and maintain.

## Usage

0. First of all, yabridge requires a recent-ish version of Wine (Staging). Users
   of Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint and Pop!\_OS should install Wine Staging from
   the [WineHQ repositories](https://wiki.winehq.org/Download) as the Wine
   versions provided by those distro's repositories may be too old to be used
   with yabridge. On other distros you should be able to just install
   `wine-staging` using your distro's package manager.

   For a general overview on how to use Wine to install Windows applications,
   check out Wine's [user
   guide](https://wiki.winehq.org/Wine_User%27s_Guide#Using_Wine).

1. Depending on your distro you can install yabridge and its yabridgectl
   companion utility through your distro's package manager or by using
   a binary archive from the GitHub releases page. Keep in mind that the distro
   packages mentioned below may not always be up to date, and some may also not
   be compiled with support for 32-bit plugins.

   <a href="https://repology.org/project/yabridge/versions" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Packaging status"><img align="right" src="https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/yabridge.svg"></a>

   - On **Arch** and **Manjaro**, yabridge and yabridgectl can be installed from
     the official repositories using the
     [`yabridge`](https://archlinux.org/packages/multilib/x86_64/yabridge/) and
     [`yabridgectl`](https://archlinux.org/packages/multilib/x86_64/yabridgectl/)
     packages.
   - On **Fedora**, you can install yabridge and yabridgectl from a
     [COPR](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/patrickl/yabridge/).
   - On the **OpenSUSE** distros, yabridge and yabridgectl are packaged by
     [GeekosDAW](https://geekosdaw.tuxfamily.org/en/).
   - On **NixOS**, yabridge and yabridgectl are in the repositories.

   - On **Ubuntu**, **Debian**, **Linux Mint**, **Pop!\_OS**, and any other
     distro, you can simply download and install a prebuilt version of yabridge:

     1. First download the latest version of yabridge from the [releases
        page](https://github.com/robbert-vdh/yabridge/releases). If you're using
        a distro that's older than Ubuntu 20.04 such as Ubuntu 18.04, Debian 10,
        Linux Mint 19, or AV Linux MXE 2021, then you should download the
        version that ends with `-ubuntu-18.04.tar.gz`.
     2. Extract the contents of the downloaded archive to `~/.local/share`, such
        that the file `~/.local/share/yabridge/yabridgectl` exists after
        extracting. You can extract an archive here from the command line with
        `tar -C ~/.local/share -xavf yabridge-x.y.z.tar.gz`. If you're
        extracting the archive using a GUI file manager or archive tool, then
        make sure that hidden files and directories are visible by pressing
        <kbd>Ctrl+H</kbd>. You should also double check that your archive
        extraction tool didn't create an additional subdirectory in
        `~/.local/share`. Dragging and dropping the `yabridge` directory from
        the archive directly to `~/.local/share` is the best way to make sure
        this doesn't happen.
     3. **Whenever any step after this mentions running `yabridgectl <something>`,
        then you should run `~/.local/share/yabridge/yabridgectl <something>`
        instead.**

        Alternatively, you can also add that directory to your shell's search
        path. That way you can run `yabridgectl` directly. If you don't know
        what that means, then add `export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.local/share/yabridge"`
        to the end of `~/.bashrc` and reopen your terminal.

2. Setting up and updating yabridge for your plugins is done though the
   `yabridgectl` command line utility. The basic idea is that you first install
   your Windows plugins to their default locations within a Wine prefix just
   like you would on regular Windows. and yabridgectl then manages those plugin
   directories for you. You then tell yabridgectl where it can find those
   plugins so it can manage them for you. That way you only ever need to run a
   single command whenever you install or remove a plugin. Both yabridge and
   yabridgectl will automatically detect your yabridge installation if you used
   one of the installation methods from step 1.

   To tell yabridgectl where it can find your Windows VST2, VST3, and CLAP
   plugins, you can use yabridgectl's `add`, `rm` and `list` commands to add,
   remove, and list the plugin directories yabridgectl is managing for you. You
   can also use `yabridgectl status` to get an overview of the current settings
   and the installation status for all of your plugins.

   1. To add the most common VST2 plugin directory in the default Wine prefix, use
      `yabridgectl add "$HOME/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/Steinberg/VstPlugins"`.
      This directory may be capitalized as `VSTPlugins` on your system, and some
      plugins may also install themselves to a similar directory directly inside
      of Program Files.
   2. VST3 plugins under Windows are always installed to
      `C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST3`, and you can use
      `yabridgectl add "$HOME/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/Common Files/VST3"` to
      add that directory to yabridge.
   3. CLAP plugins under Windows are always installed to
      `C:\Program Files\Common Files\CLAP`, and you can use
      `yabridgectl add "$HOME/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/Common Files/CLAP"` to
      add that directory to yabridge.

3. Finally, you'll need to run `yabridgectl sync` to finish setting up yabridge
   for all of your plugins. After doing so, your VST2, VST3, and CLAP plugins
   will be set up in `~/.vst/yabridge`, `~/.vst3/yabridge`, and
   `~/.clap/yabridge` respectively. Make sure your DAW searches `~/.vst`,
   `~/.vst3`, and `~/.clap` for VST2, VST3, and CLAP plugins and you will be
   good to go.

### Bitbridge

Yabridge can also load 32-bit Windows plugins so you can use them in your 64-bit
Linux DAW. Yabridge will automatically detect whether a plugin is 32-bit or
64-bit on startup and it will handle it accordingly. If you've installed
yabridge through a distro package, then it may be possible that your distro has
disabled this feature.

### Wine prefixes

It is also possible to use yabridge with multiple Wine prefixes at the same
time. Yabridge will automatically detect and use the Wine prefix the Windows
plugin's `.dll`, `.vst3`, or `.clap` file is located in. Alternatively, you can
set the `WINEPREFIX` environment variable to override the Wine prefix for _all
yabridge plugins_.

### Drag-and-drop

Yabridge supports drag-and-drop both from a native (X11) Linux application to
plugins running under yabridge, as well as from yabridge plugins to native X11
applications like your DAW or your file browser. When dragging things from a
plugin to your DAW, then depending on which DAW you're using it may look like
the drop is going to fail while you're still holding down the left mouse button.
That's expected, since yabridge's and Wine's own drag-and-drop systems are
active at the same time. If you're using yabridge in _REAPER_ or _Carla_, then
you may need to enable a [compatibility option](#compatibility-options) to
prevent those hosts from stealing the drop.

### Input focus grabbing

Yabridge tries to be clever about the way grabbing and releasing input focus for
a plugin works. One important detail here is that when grabbing input focus,
yabridge will always focus the _parent window_ passed by the host for the plugin
to embed itself into. This means that hosts like Bitwig Studio can still process
common key bindings like <kbd>Space</kbd> for play/pause even while you are
interacting with a plugin's GUI. The downside of this approach is that this also
means that in those hosts you simply cannot type a space character, as the key
will always go to the host.

For the very specific situations where you may want to focus the plugin's editor
directly so that all keyboard input goes to Wine, you can hold down the
<kbd>Shift</kbd> key while entering the plugin's GUI with your mouse. This will
let you type spaces in text fields in **Bitwig Studio**, type text into the
settings and license dialogs in **Voxengo** plugins, and it will also allow you
to navigate dropdowns with the keyboard.

### Downgrading Wine

If you run into software or a plugin that does not work correctly with the
current version of Wine Staging, then you may want to try downgrading to an
earlier version of Wine. This can be done as follows:

- On Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint and other apt-based distros, you can use the
  command below to install Wine Staging 7.20 after you add the WineHQ
  repositories linked above. This command is a bit cryptic because on these
  distros the Wine package is split up into multiple smaller packages, and the
  package versions include the distros codename (e.g. `focal`, or `buster`) as
  well as some numeric suffix. Change the version to whatever version of Wine
  you want to install, and then run these commands under Bash:

  ```shell
  version=7.20
  variant=staging
  codename=$(shopt -s nullglob; awk '/^deb https:\/\/dl\.winehq\.org/ { print $3; exit 0 } END { exit 1 }' /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/*.list || awk '/^Suites:/ { print $2; exit }' /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/wine*.sources)
  suffix=$(dpkg --compare-versions "$version" ge 6.1 && ((dpkg --compare-versions "$version" eq 6.17 && echo "-2") || echo "-1"))
  sudo apt install --install-recommends {"winehq-$variant","wine-$variant","wine-$variant-amd64","wine-$variant-i386"}="$version~$codename$suffix"
  ```

  If you want to prevent these packages from being updated automatically, then
  you can do so with:

  ```shell
  sudo apt-mark hold winehq-staging
  ```

  Running the same command with `unhold` instead of `hold` will enable updates
  again.

- On Arch and Manjaro, you can install the
  [downgrade](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/downgrade/) tool from the repos
  or the AUR, then run:

  ```shell
  sudo env DOWNGRADE_FROM_ALA=1 downgrade wine-staging
  ```

  Then select the package for the wine-staging version you want to isntall from
  the list. After installing downgrade will ask if you want to add the package
  to `IgnorePkg`. If you select `yes`, the package will be added to the
  `IgnorePkg` field in `/etc/pacman.conf` and it won't be updated again
  automatically.

### Installing a development build

If you want to try to a development version of yabridge, then you can do so as
follows:

- On Arch and Manjaro, you can install the latest master branch version of
  yabridge by installing the
  [yabridge-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/yabridge-git/) and
  [yabridgectl-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/yabridgectl-git/) AUR
  packages.
- Otherwise, you can find development builds on the [automated build
  page](https://github.com/robbert-vdh/yabridge/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Automated+builds%22+branch%3Amaster).
  Before you can download these files, you need log in to GitHub. Then simply
  select the latest commit with a green checkmark next to it, scroll down the
  build page, and download the latest yabridge and yabridgectl binaries that
  match your system. You can also access the very latest build from [this
  page](https://nightly.link/robbert-vdh/yabridge/workflows/build/master)
  without logging in to GitHub. You'll need to extract these files twice, since
  GitHub automatically puts the tarball inside of a .zip archive. Then simply
  overwrite the existing files in `~/.local/share/yabridge` with the ones from
  the `yabridge` directory, and replace `~/.local/share/yabridge/yabridgectl`
  with the new `yabridgectl/yabridgectl` binary. It's also possible to use these
  builds if you're using a distro package, but then you should remove the
  package first in order to avoid conflicts.

After updating yabridge's files, you will need to rerun `yabridgectl sync` to
finish the upgrade.

## Configuration

Yabridge can be configured on a per plugin basis to host multiple plugins within
a single process using [plugin groups](#plugin-groups), and there are also a
number of [compatibility options](#compatibility-options) available to improve
compatibility with certain hosts and plugins.

Configuring yabridge is done by creating a `yabridge.toml` file located in
either the same directory as the bridged plugin `.so` or `.clap` file you're
trying to configure, or in any of its parent directories. In most cases, this
file should be created as either `~/.vst/yabridge/yabridge.toml`,
`~/.vst3/yabridge/yabridge.toml`, or `~/.clap/yabridge/yabridge.toml` depending
on the type of plugin you want to configure.

Configuration files contain several _sections_. Each section can match one or
more plugins using case sensitive
[glob](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/glob.7.html) patterns that
match paths to yabridge `.so` and `.clap` files relative to the `yabridge.toml`
file, as well as a list of options to apply to the matched plugins. These glob
patterns can also match entire directories, in which case the settings are
applied to all plugins under that directory or one of its subdirectories. To
avoid confusion, only the first `yabridge.toml` file found and only the first
matching glob pattern within that file will be considered. See below for an
[example](#example) of a `yabridge.toml` file. To make debugging easier,
yabridge will print the used `yabridge.toml` file and the matched section within
it on startup, as well as all of the options that have been set.

### Plugin groups

| Option  | Values            | Description                                                            |
| ------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `group` | `{"<string>",""}` | Defaults to `""`, meaning that the plugin will be hosted individually. |

Some plugins have the ability to communicate with other instances of that same
plugin or even with other plugins made by the same manufacturer. This is often
used in mixing plugins to allow different tracks to reference each other without
having to route audio between them. Examples of plugins that do this are
FabFilter Pro-Q 3, MMultiAnalyzer and the iZotope mixing plugins. In order for
this to work, all instances of a particular plugin will have to be hosted in the
same process.

Yabridge has the concept of _plugin groups_, which are user defined groups of
plugins that will all be hosted inside of a single process. Plugins groups can
be configured for a plugin by setting the `group` option of that plugin to some
name. All plugins with the same group name will be hosted within a single
process. Of course, plugin groups with the same name but in different Wine
prefixes and with different architectures will be run independently of each
other. See below for an [example](#example) of how these groups can be set up.

_Note that because of the way VST3 and CLAP work, multiple instances of a single
VST3 or CLAP plugin will always be hosted in a single process regardless of
whether you have enabled plugin groups or not._ _The only reason to use plugin
groups with those plugins is to get slightly lower loading times the first time
you load a new plugin._

### Compatibility options

| Option                        | Values                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `disable_pipes`               | `{true,false,<string>}` | When this option is enabled, yabridge will redirect the Wine plugin host's output streams to a file without any further processing. See the [known issues](#known-issues-and-fixes) section for a list of plugins where this may be useful. This can be set to a boolean, in which case the output will be written to `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/yabridge-plugin-output.log`, or to an absolute path (with no expansion for tildes or environment variables). Defaults to `false`.           |
| `editor_coordinate_hack`      | `{true,false}`          | Compatibility option for plugins that rely on the absolute screen coordinates of the window they're embedded in. Since the Wine window gets embedded inside of a window provided by your DAW, these coordinates won't match up and the plugin would end up drawing in the wrong location without this option. Currently the only known plugins that require this option are _PSPaudioware E27_ and _Soundtoys Crystallizer_. Defaults to `false`.                                   |
| `editor_disable_host_scaling` | `{true,false}`          | Disable host-driven HiDPI scaling for VST3 and CLAP plugins. Wine currently does not have proper fractional HiDPI support, so you might have to enable this option if you're using a HiDPI display. In most cases setting the font DPI in `winecfg`'s graphics tab to 192 will cause plugins to scale correctly at 200% size. Defaults to `false`.                                                                                                                                  |
| `editor_force_dnd`            | `{true,false}`          | This option forcefully enables drag-and-drop support in _REAPER_. Because REAPER's FX window supports drag-and-drop itself, dragging a file onto a plugin editor will cause the drop to be intercepted by the FX window. This makes it impossible to drag files onto plugins in REAPER under normal circumstances. Setting this option to `true` will strip drag-and-drop support from the FX window, thus allowing files to be dragged onto the plugin again. Defaults to `false`. |
| `editor_xembed`               | `{true,false}`          | Use Wine's XEmbed implementation instead of yabridge's normal window embedding method. Some plugins will have redrawing issues when using XEmbed and editor resizing won't always work properly with it, but it could be useful in certain setups. You may need to use [this Wine patch](https://github.com/psycha0s/airwave/blob/master/fix-xembed-wine-windows.patch) if you're getting blank editor windows. Defaults to `false`.                                                |
| `frame_rate`                  | `<number>`              | The rate at which Win32 events are being handled and usually also the refresh rate of a plugin's editor GUI. When using plugin groups all plugins share the same event handling loop, so in those the last loaded plugin will set the refresh rate. Defaults to `60`.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `hide_daw`                    | `{true,false}`          | Don't report the name of the actual DAW to the plugin. See the [known issues](#known-issues-and-fixes) section for a list of situations where this may be useful. This affects VST2, VST3, and CLAP plugins. Defaults to `false`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `vst3_prefer_32bit`           | `{true,false}`          | Use the 32-bit version of a VST3 plugin instead the 64-bit version if both are installed and they're in the same VST3 bundle inside of `~/.vst3/yabridge`. You likely won't need this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

These options are workarounds for issues mentioned in the [known
issues](#known-issues-and-fixes) section. Depending on the hosts
and plugins you use you might want to enable some of them.

### Example

All of the paths used here are relative to the `yabridge.toml` file. A
configuration file for VST2 plugins might look a little something like this:

```toml
# ~/.vst/yabridge/yabridge.toml

["FabFilter Pro-Q 3.so"]
group = "fabfilter"

["MeldaProduction/Tools/MMultiAnalyzer.so"]
group = "melda"

# Matches an entire directory and all files inside it, make sure to not include
# a trailing slash
["ToneBoosters"]
group = "toneboosters"

["PSPaudioware"]
editor_coordinate_hack = true

["Analog Lab 3.so"]
editor_xembed = true

["Chromaphone 3.so"]
hide_daw = true

["sforzando VST_x64.so"]
editor_force_dnd = true
frame_rate = 24

["Loopcloud*"]
disable_pipes = true

# Simple glob patterns can be used to avoid unneeded repetition
["iZotope*/Neutron *"]
group = "izotope"

# Since this file has already been matched by the above glob pattern, this won't
# do anything
["iZotope7/Neutron 2 Mix Tap.so"]
group = "This will be ignored!"

# Of course, you can also add multiple plugins to the same group by hand
["iZotope7/Insight 2.so"]
group = "izotope"

# This would cause all plugins to be hosted within a single process. Doing so
# greatly reduces the loading time of individual plugins, with the caveat being
# that plugins are no longer sandboxed from each other.
#
# ["*"]
# group = "all"
```

For VST3 plugins you should just match the directory instead of the `.so` file
deep within in, like this:

```toml
# ~/.vst3/yabridge/yabridge.toml

["FabFilter*.vst3"]
group = "fabfilter"
editor_disable_host_scaling = true

["Chromaphone 3.vst3"]
hide_daw = true

["Misstortion2.vst3"]
editor_disable_host_scaling = true

["*/*Spectral*.vst3"]
vst3_prefer_32bit = true

# These options would be applied to all plugins that do not already have their
# own configuration set
["*"]
editor_force_dnd = true
editor_disable_host_scaling = true
```

With CLAP plugins, you match on the Linux `.clap` plugin file, just like
matching on `.so` files for a VST2 config file:

```toml
# ~/.clap/yabridge/yabridge.toml

["fb799964.clap"]
hide_daw = true
```

## Known issues and fixes

Any plugin should function out of the box, although some plugins will need some
additional dependencies for their GUIs to work correctly. Notable examples
include:

- If plugins have missing, invisible, or misaligned text, then installing
  `corefonts` or `allfonts` through `winetricks` may help.
- If a plugin seems to work fine except for the fact that the GUI never seems to
  update when you interact with it, then try installing
  [DXVK](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk). Many recent JUCE-based plugins
  don't redraw anymore when using WineD3D.
- **Serum** requires you to disable `d2d1.dll` in `winecfg` and to install
  `gdiplus` through `winetricks`. You may also want to disable the tooltips by
  going to the global settings tab, unchecking 'Show help tooltips', and
  clicking on the save icon next to 'Preferences'.
- **Native Instruments** plugins work, but the latest version of Native Access
  doesn't run under Wine. You can find Native Access 1 on the [legacy
  installers](https://support.native-instruments.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000407909-Native-Access-1-Legacy-Installers-for-Older-Operating-Systems)
  page on Native Instruments' website. To get the installer to finish correctly,
  open `winecfg` and set the reported Windows version to Windows 10. Otherwise
  the installer will be stuck on installing an ISO driver. To work around this
  you can open the .iso file downloaded to your downloads directory and run the
  installer directly.

  Some plugins or sound libraries will install as expected, but if you get an
  'Error while mounting disk image' installation failure, then you will need to
  install the plugin or sound library manually. You will find a .iso file in
  your downloads directory that you can mount and then run the installer from.
  However some of those Native Instruments .iso files contain hidden files, and
  the installer on the .iso file will fail to install unless you mount the .iso
  file with the correct mounting options to unhide those files. To do this,
  first run `udisksctl loop-setup -f ~/Downloads/<filename>.iso` to load the
  .iso file, and then use `udisksctl mount -t udf -o unhide -b /dev/loopX` where
  `/dev/loopX` corresponds to the loop device printed by the `loop-setup`
  command to mount the .iso file to a directory in `/run/media`.

  If you're using an older distro and you're getting a
  `Mount option 'unhide' is not allowed` error when trying to mount the file,
  then you may need to manually create or edit `/etc/udisks2/mount_options.conf`
  first, adding the following to the file:

  ```conf
  [defaults]
  udf_allow=uid=$UID,gid=$GID,iocharset,utf8,umask,mode,dmode,unhide,undelete
  ```

- If **Spitfire Audio** plugins like **BBC Symphony Orchestra** and **LABS** are
  unable to load their sample libraries (_Error #X: Something went wrong_), then
  you can try reinstalling those plugins to a new, clean Wine prefix. To avoid
  potential confusion, make sure to uninstall the Spitfire software along with
  the VST2 and VST3 plugins from your main Wine prefix first.
- Several **JUCE** based plugins have an issue under Wine where the mouse cursor
  will disappear after interacting with certain UI elements. This can usually be
  fixed by mousing over the resize handle in the bottom right corner.
- Several (JUCE-based) plugins like **Arturia**'s plugins, Sonic Academy's
  **Kick 2** and Cytomic's **The Drop** have an issue where the GUI freezes when
  it's trying to display a tooltip. This can be fixed by enabling the '_Hide
  Wine version from applications_' option in the Staging tab of winecfg. If a
  plugin seems to function normally but then freezes when clicking on something,
  then try enabling this option.
- The GUI in **Sforzando** may appear to not respond to mouse clicks depending
  on your Wine and system configuration. This is actually a redrawing issue, and
  the GUI will still be updated even if it doesn't look that way. Dragging the
  window around or just clicking anywhere in the GUI will force a redraw and
  make the GUI render correctly again.
- **MeldaProduction** plugins have minor rendering issues when GPU acceleration
  is enabled. This can be fixed by disabling GPU acceleration in the plugin
  settings. I'm not sure whether this is an issue with Wine or the plugins
  themselves. Notable issues here are missing redraws and incorrect positioning
  when the window gets dragged offscreen on the top and left sides of the screen.
- Knobs in **Tokyo Dawn Records** plugins may not behave as expected when
  dragging long distances. Setting the 'Continuous Drag' option in the plugin's
  options to 'Linear' fixes the issue.
- Similarly, the knobs in **Voxengo** plugins behave better when you enable the
  'Radial knob mode' setting in the global settings.
- If **Scaler 2**'s interface lags, blacks out, or otherwise renders poorly,
  then you can try enabling [software
  rendering](https://forum.scalerplugin.com/t/scaler-2-black-empty-window/3540/8)
  to fix these issues.
- **ujam** plugins and other plugins made with the Gorilla Engine, such as the
  **LoopCloud** plugins, will throw a `JS_EXEC_FAILED` error when trying to load
  the plugin. Enabling the `disable_pipes` [compatibility
  option](#compatibility-options) for those plugins will fix this.
- Plugins by **KiloHearts** have file descriptor leaks when _esync_ is enabled,
  causing Wine and yabridge to eventually stop working after the system hits the
  open file limit. To fix this, either unset `WINEESYNC` while using yabridge or
  switch to using [_fsync_](#performance-tuning) instead.
- **PSPaudioware** and **Soundtoys** plugins with expandable GUIs, such as E27
  and Crystallizer, may have their GUI appear in the wrong location after the
  GUI has been expanded. You can enable an alternative [editor hosting
  mode](#compatibility-options) to fix this.
- When using recent _Applied Acoustics_ plugins like **Chromaphone 3** under
  _Bitwig Studio_, text entry will cause the plugin to crash because Chromaphone
  uses a different text entry method when it detects Bitwig. You can use the
  `hide_daw` [compatibility option](#compatibility-options) to work around this.
- VST2 plugins like **FabFilter Pro-Q 3** that can share data between different
  instances of the same plugin plugins have to be hosted within a single process
  for that functionality to work. See the [plugin groups](#plugin-groups)
  section for instructions on how to set this up. This is not necessary for VST3
  plugins, as multiple instances of those plugins will always be hosted in a
  single process by design.
- Some hosts, particularly _Ardour_, _REAPER_, _Qtractor_, will by default not
  unload VST3 modules after you close the last plugin. This means that the
  associated `yabridge-host.exe` process will keep running until you close the
  project. For REAPER there's an option called
  `Allow complete unload of VST plug-ins` in the `VST` tab of the settings
  dialog to disable this behaviour.
- _Drag-and-drop_ to the plugin window under **REAPER** doesn't work because of
  a long standing issue in REAPER's FX window implementation. You can use a
  compatibility option to [force drag-and-drop](#compatibility-options) to work
  around this limitation.

Aside from that, these are some known caveats:

- **iZotope** plugins can't be authorized because of missing functionality in
  Wine's crypt32 implementation.
- **D16 Group** plugins also can't be authorized in current versions of Wine as
  they don't recall their authorization status correctly.
- **Waves** V13 VST3 plugins have memory issues, at least under Wine. They will
  likely randomly crash at some point. If you can avoid Waves, that would be for
  the best. Otherwise, try the V12 versions of the plugins if you still have a
  license for them.
- MIDI key labels for VST2 plugins (commonly used for drum machines and
  multisamplers) will not be updated after the host first asks for them since
  VST 2.4 has no way to let the host know that those labels have been updated.
  Deactivating and reactivating the plugin will cause these labels to be updated
  again for the current patch.
- The Cinnamon desktop environment has some quirks with its window management
  that affect yabridge's plugin editor embedding. Most notably some plugins may
  flicker while dragging windows around, and there may be [rendering
  issues](https://github.com/robbert-vdh/yabridge/issues/89) when using multiple
  monitors depending on which screen has been set as primary. Enabling the
  XEmbed [compatibility option](#compatibility-options) may help, but Wine's
  XEmbed implementation also introduces other rendering issues.

There are also some (third party) plugin API extensions for that have not been
implemented yet. See the [roadmap](./ROADMAP.md) for a list of future plans.

## Troubleshooting common issues

If your problem is not listed here, then feel free to post on the [issue
tracker](https://github.com/robbert-vdh/yabridge/issues) or to ask about it in
the yabridge [Discord](https://discord.gg/pyNeweqadf). Also check the [known
issues and fixes](#known-issues-and-fixes) section above for help with
plugin-specific issues.

- Old versions of yabridge may not work correctly with Wine 7.21, 7.22, and
  8.0-rc1 because of Wine bug
  [#53912](https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=53912). Either update to
  yabridge 5.0.3, or [downgrade to Wine Staging 7.20](#downgrading-wine).

- Both yabridgectl and yabridge try to diagnose many common issues for you. If
  you're running into crashes or other issues, then try launching your DAW from
  a terminal and reading the log output for any clues. Bitwig Studio writes
  plugin output to `~/.BitwigStudio/log/engine.log`, so you may need to look
  there instead.

- Try to use a clean Wine prefix when testing misbehaving plugins. Either
  temporarily rename `~/.wine` to something else, or set the `WINEPREFIX`
  environment variable to a directory path to have Wine use that as a prefix.
  Don't forget to unset it before starting your DAW or all plugins will use that
  prefix.

- If you have the `WINEPREFIX` environment variable set and you _don't_ want all
  of your plugins to use that specific Wine prefix, then you should unset it to
  allow yabridge to automatically detect Wine prefixes for you.

- If yabridge prints errors or warnings about memory locking limits, then that
  means that you have not yet set up realtime privileges for your user. Setting
  the memlock limit to unlimited (or -1) is usually part of this process. How
  you should do this will depend on your distro. On _Arch_ and _Manjaro_, you
  will need to install the `realtime-privileges` package, add your user to the
  `realtime` group with `sudo gpasswd -a "$USER" realtime`, and then reboot.
  _Fedora_ does the same thing with their `realtime-setup` package, which also
  sets up a `realtime` group that you will need to add your user to. On
  _Debian_, _Ubuntu_, and distros based on those, the `jackd2` package usually
  sets this up for the `audio` group instead. If
  `/etc/security/limits.d/audio.conf` exists, then you can simply add yourself
  to the `audio` group and reboot. In any other case you may need to [set this
  up yourself](https://jackaudio.org/faq/linux_rt_config.html).

- The above process also applies to warnings about low `RLIMIT_RTTIME` values
  when using PipeWire's JACK implementation. If you don't change this, then
  certain slow loading plugins may crash during initialization or at any other
  time. **Starting with PipeWire 0.3.44, you only need to make sure your user
  has realtime privileges to resolve this warning.** If your user does not have
  these permissions, then PipeWire will use RTKit instead of regular realtime
  scheduling which requires this limit to be set for it to work. You may also
  want to give [this](https://github.com/robbert-vdh/dotfiles#pipewire)
  optimized PipeWire configuration a try.

- If you're seeing errors related to Wine either when running `yabridgectl sync`
  or when trying to load a plugin, then it can be that your installed version of
  Wine is much older than the version that yabridge has been compiled for.
  Yabridgectl will automatically check for this when you run `yabridgectl sync`
  after updating Wine or yabridge. You can also manually verify that Wine is
  working correctly by running one of the Wine plugin host applications.
  Assuming that yabridge is installed under `~/.local/share/yabridge`, then
  running `~/.local/share/yabridge/yabridge-host.exe` directly (so _not_
  `wine ~/.local/share/yabridge/yabridge-host.exe`, that won't work) in a terminal
  should print a few messages related to Wine's startup process followed by the
  following line:

  ```
  Usage: yabridge-host.exe <plugin_type> <plugin_location> <endpoint_base_directory>
  ```

  If you're seeing a `002b:err:module:__wine_process_init` error instead, then
  your version of Wine is too old for this version of yabridge and you'll have
  to upgrade your Wine version. Instructions for how to do this on Ubuntu can be
  found on the [WineHQ website](https://wiki.winehq.org/Ubuntu).

  If you're getting a `0024:err:process:exec_process` error, then your Wine
  prefix is set to 32-bit only and it won't be possible to run 64-bit
  applications like `yabridge-host.exe`.

- Sometimes left over Wine processes can cause problems. Run `wineserver -k` to
  terminate Wine related in the current or default Wine prefix.

- If plugin windows show up as a large overlay over the entire screen, covering
  up other windows and making it impossible to interact with anything else
  without Alt+Tabbing to them, then make sure the 'Allow the window manager to
  control the windows' checkbox in winecfg's Graphics tab is checked.

- If you're using a _lot_ of plugins and you're unable to load any new plugins,
  then you may be running into Xorg's limit of 256 clients. The exact number of
  plugins it takes for this to happen will depend on your system and the other
  applications running in the background. An easy way to check if this is the
  case would be to try and run `wine cmd.exe` from a terminal. If this prints a
  message about the maximum number of clients being reached (or if you are not
  able to open the terminal at all), then you might want to consider using
  [plugin groups](#plugin-groups) to run multiple instances of your most
  frequently used plugins within a single process. And if you're using many
  instances of a single VST2 plugin, using the VST3 or CLAP version of that
  plugin may also help since they'll share a single process.

- If you're using a `WINELOADER` that runs the Wine process under a separate
  namespace while the host is not sandboxed, then you'll have to use the
  `YABRIDGE_NO_WATCHDOG` environment variable to disable the watchdog timer. If
  you know what this means then you probably know what you're doing. In that
  case, you may also want to use `YABRIDGE_TEMP_DIR` to choose a different
  directory for yabridge to store its sockets and other temporary files in.

## Performance tuning

Running Windows plugins under Wine should have a minimal performance overhead,
but you may still notice an increase in latency spikes and overall DSP load.
Luckily there are a few things you can do to get rid of most or all of these
negative side effects:

- First of all, you'll want to make sure that you can run programs with realtime
  scheduling. Note that on Arch and Manjaro this does not necessarily require a
  realtime kernel as they include the `PREEMPT` patch set in their regular
  kernels. You can verify that this is working correctly by running `chrt -f 10 whoami`,
  which should print your username, and running `uname -a` should print
  something that contains `PREEMPT` in the output.

  If the `uname -a` output contains `PREEMPT_DYNAMIC`, then run either
  `zgrep PREEMPT /proc/config.gz` or `grep PREEMPT "/boot/config-$(uname -r)"`
  depending on your distro. If `CONFIG_PREEMPT` is not set, then either add the
  `preempt=full` kernel parameter or better yet, switch to a kernel that's
  optimized for low latencies.

- You can also try enabling the `threadirqs` kernel parameter and using which
  can in some situations help with xruns. After enabling this, you can use
  [rtirq](https://github.com/rncbc/rtirq#rtirq) to increase the priority of
  interrupts for your sound card.

- Make sure that you're using the performance frequency scaling governor, as
  changing clock speeds in the middle of a real time workload can cause latency
  spikes. Since Linux 5.9 it's possible to do this by setting the
  `cpufreq.default_governor=performance` to the kernel's command line in your
  boot loader configuration.

- The last but perhaps the most important thing you can do is to use a build of
  Wine compiled with Proton's fsync or FUTEX2 patches. This can improve
  performance significantly when using certain multithreaded plugins. If you are
  running Arch or Manjaro, then you can use [Tk-Glitch's Wine
  fork](https://github.com/Frogging-Family/wine-tkg-git) for a customizable
  version of Wine with the fsync patches included. Make sure to follow the
  instructions in the readme to build a version of wine-tkg using the default
  profile and don't try to use the prebuilt releases as they will have fshack
  enabled which tends to break many plugins that use Direct3D for their
  rendering. You'll also want to make sure you're running Linux kernel 5.16 or
  newer as those include support the `_fsync_futex_waitv` option that's enabled
  by default though wine-tkg's `customization.cfg`. Finally, you'll have to set
  the `WINEFSYNC` environment variable to `1` to enable fsync. See the
  [environment configuration](#environment-configuration) section below for more
  information on where to set this environment variable so that it gets picked
  up when you start your DAW.

- If you have the choice, the VST3 version of a plugin will likely perform
  better than the VST2 version. And if there is a CLAP version, then that may
  perform even better.

- If the plugin doesn't have a VST3 or CLAP version, then [plugin
  groups](#plugin-groups) can also greatly improve performance when many
  instances of same VST2 plugin. _VST3 and CLAP plugins have similar
  functionality built in by design_. Some plugins, like the BBC Spitfire
  plugins, can share a lot of resources between different instances of the
  plugin. Hosting all instances of the same plugin in a single process can in
  those cases greatly reduce overall CPU usage and get rid of latency spikes.

### Environment configuration

This section is relevant if you want to configure environment variables in such
a way that they will be set when you launch your DAW from the GUI instead of
from a terminal. You may want to enable `WINEFSYNC` for fsync support with a
compatible Wine version and kernel, or you may want to change your search `PATH`
to allow yabridge to find the `yabridge-*.exe` binaries if you're using yabridge
directly from the `build` directory. To do this you'll need to change your
_login shell's_ profile, which is different from the configuration loaded during
interactive sessions. And some display manager override your login shell to
always use `/bin/sh`, so you need to be careful to modify the correct file or
else these changes won't work. You can find out your current login shell by
running `echo $SHELL` in a terminal.

- First of all, if you're using GDM, LightDM or LXDM as your display manager
  (for instance if you're using GNOME, XFCE or LXDE), then your display manager
  won't respect your login shell and it will always use `/bin/sh`. In that case
  you will need to add the following line to `~/.profile` to enable fsync:

  ```shell
  export WINEFSYNC=1
  ```

- If you are using the default **Bash** shell and you're not using any of the
  above display managers, then you will want to add the following line to
  `~/.bash_profile` (or `~/.profile` if the former does not exist):

  ```shell
  export WINEFSYNC=1
  ```

- If you are using **Zsh**, then you can add the following line to `~/.zprofile`
  (`~/.zshenv` should also work, but some distros such as Arch Linux overwrite
  the environment after this file has been read):

  ```shell
  export WINEFSYNC=1
  ```

- If you are using **fish**, then you can add the following line to either
  `~/.config/fish/config.fish` or some file in `~/.config/fish/conf.d/`:

  ```shell
  set -gx WINEFSYNC 1
  # Or if you're changing your PATH:
  set -gp fish_user_paths ~/directory/with/yabridge/binaries
  ```

_Make sure to log out and log back in again to ensure that all applications pick
up the new changes._

## Building

To compile yabridge, you'll need [Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/index.html) and
the following dependencies:

- GCC 10+[\*](#building-ubuntu-18.04)
- A Wine installation with `winegcc` and the development headers. The latest
  commits contain a workaround for a winelib [compilation
  issue](https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=49138) with Wine 5.7+.
- libxcb

The following dependencies are included in the repository as a Meson wrap:

- [Asio](http://think-async.com/Asio/)
- [bitsery](https://github.com/fraillt/bitsery)
- [function2](https://github.com/Naios/function2)
- [`ghc::filesystem`](https://github.com/gulrak/filesystem)
- [tomlplusplus](https://github.com/marzer/tomlplusplus)
- Version 3.7.7 of the [VST3 SDK](https://github.com/robbert-vdh/vst3sdk) with
  some [patches](https://github.com/robbert-vdh/yabridge/blob/master/tools/patch-vst3-sdk.sh)
  to allow Winelib compilation
- Version 1.1.7 of the [CLAP headers](https://github.com/free-audio/clap).

The project can then be compiled with the command below. You can remove or
change the unity size argument if building takes up too much RAM, or you can
disable unity builds completely by getting rid of `--unity=on` at the cost of
slightly longer build times.

```shell
meson setup build --buildtype=release --cross-file=cross-wine.conf --unity=on --unity-size=1000
ninja -C build
```

After you've finished building you can follow the instructions under the
[usage](#usage) section on how to set up yabridge.

<sup id="building-ubuntu-18.04">
  *The version of GCC that ships with Ubuntu 18.04 by default is too old to
  compile yabridge. If you do wish to build yabridge from scratch rather than
  using the <a
  href="https://github.com/robbert-vdh/yabridge/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Automated+builds%22+branch%3Amaster">prebuilt
  binaries</a>, then you should take a look at the <a
  href="https://github.com/robbert-vdh/docker-yabridge/blob/master/bionic/Dockerfile">docker
  image</a> used when building yabridge on Ubuntu 18.04 for on overview of what
  would need to be installed to compile on Ubuntu 18.04.
</sup>

### 32-bit bitbridge

It is also possible to compile a host application for yabridge that's compatible
with 32-bit plugins such as old SynthEdit plugins. This will allow yabridge to
act as a bitbridge, allowing you to run old 32-bit only Windows plugins in a
modern 64-bit Linux plugin host. For this you'll need to have installed the 32
bit versions of the XCB library. This can then be set up as follows:

```shell
# Enable the bitbridge on an existing build
meson configure build -Dbitbridge=true
# Or configure a new build from scratch
meson setup build --buildtype=release --cross-file cross-wine.conf -Dbitbridge=true

ninja -C build
```

This will produce a second plugin host binary called `yabridge-host-32.exe`.
Yabridge will detect whether the plugin you're trying to load is 32-bit or
64-bit, and will run either the regular version or the `*-32.exe` variant
accordingly.

### 32-bit libraries

It also possible to build 32-bit versions of yabridge's libraries, which would
let you use both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows VST2, VST3, and CLAP plugins from a
32-bit Linux plugin host. This is mostly untested since 32-bit only Linux
applications don't really exist anymore, but it should work! The build system
will still assume you're compiling from a 64-bit system, so if you're compiling
on an actual 32-bit system you would need to comment out the 64-bit
`yabridge-host` and `yabridge-group` binaries in `meson.build`:

```shell
meson setup build --buildtype=release --cross-file=cross-wine.conf --unity=on --unity-size=1000 -Dbitbridge=true -Dbuild.cpp_args='-m32' -Dbuild.cpp_link_args='-m32'
ninja -C build
```

Like the above commands, you might need to tweak the unity size based on the
amount of system memory available. See the CI build definitions for some
examples on how to add static linking in the mix if you're going to run this
version of yabridge on some other machine.

## Debugging

Wine's error messages and warning are usually very helpful whenever a plugin
doesn't work right away. However, with some hosts it can be hard read a plugin's
output. To make it easier to debug malfunctioning plugins, yabridge offers these
two environment variables to control yabridge's logging facilities:

- `YABRIDGE_DEBUG_FILE=<path>` allows you to write yabridge's debug messages as
  well as all output produced by the plugin and by Wine itself to a file. For
  instance, you could launch your DAW with
  `env YABRIDGE_DEBUG_FILE=/tmp/yabridge.log <daw>`, and then use
  `tail -F /tmp/yabridge.log` to keep track of the output. If this option is not
  present then yabridge will write all of its debug output to STDERR instead.
- `YABRIDGE_DEBUG_LEVEL={0,1,2}{,+editor}` allows you to set the verbosity of
  the debug information. You can set a debug level, optionally followed by
  `+editor` to also get more debug output related to the editor window handling.
  Each level increases the amount of debug information printed:

  - A value of `0` (the default) means that yabridge will only log the output
    from the Wine process and some basic information about the
    environment, the configuration and the plugin being loaded.
  - A value of `1` will log detailed information about most events and function
    calls sent between the plugin host and the plugin. This filters out some
    noisy events such as `effEditIdle()` and `audioMasterGetTime()` since those
    are sent multiple times per second by for every plugin.
  - A value of `2` will cause all of the events to be logged without any
    filtering. This is very verbose but it can be crucial for debugging
    plugin-specific problems.

  More detailed information about these debug levels can be found in
  `src/common/logging.h`.

See the [bug report
template](https://github.com/robbert-vdh/yabridge/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml)
for an example of how to use this.

Wine's own [logging facilities](https://wiki.winehq.org/Debug_Channels) can also
be very helpful when diagnosing problems. In particular the `+message`,
`+module` and `+relay` channels are very useful to trace the execution path
within the loaded plugin itself.

### Attaching a debugger

To debug the plugin, you can just attach gdb to the host. Debugging the Wine
plugin host is a bit trickier. Wine comes with a GDB proxy for winedbg, but it
requires a little bit of additional setup and it expects the command line
arguments to be a valid Win32 command line. You'll also need to launch winedbg
in a seperate detached terminal emulator so it doesn't terminate together with
the plugin, and winedbg can be a bit picky about the arguments it accepts. I've
already set this up behind a feature flag for use in KDE Plasma. Other desktop
environments and window managers will require some slight modifications in
`src/plugin/host-process.cpp`. To enable this, simply run the follow and then
rebuild yabridge:

```shell
meson configure build --buildtype=debug -Dwinedbg=true
```
